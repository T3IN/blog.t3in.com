<p>The TYPO3 extension Calendar Base (extension key: cal)  is one of the best coded extension I have come across in a long time. It was a great learning experience and the challenge was stimulating!</p>



<h4>About the extension</h4>



<p>Calendar Base extension is a full-featured online calendar system. And works with popular calendar systems such as Yahoo! Calendar, Google Calendar, and Microsoft Outlook. In addition to these common calendar systems, Calendar Base is compatible with any other applications support the iCal standard data format.</p>



<p>It shows calendar and events in various formats like days, weeks, months etc. Searches, personal calendar, RSS, exports and many more. Please see the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="cal extension documentation (opens in a new tab)" href="https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/cal/stable/" target="_blank">cal extension documentation</a> for more details.</p>



<h4>The magic inside</h4>



<p>Unlike many TYPO3 extension cal is highly flexible in configuration and hence can be a bit of complicated job to configure it at times. Mostly of the things are implemented as service. And it has multiple controllers like the main controller, the frontend controller and the backend controller.</p>



<h4>Extending Calendar Base (cal)</h4>



<p>While working on extending Calendar Base (cal) we came across few approaches by other but most seemed novice or &#8220;dirty&#8221; implementations. Few used JavaScript to alter the frontend view and some used TypoScript as a work around. None seem to understand the beauty of code of this extension. Given the scarce information is certainly was a task that would take lot more effort.</p>



<h4>Event search with multiple category selection with category stats</h4>



<p>Getting inside the code of the extension and understanding it implementation was a great experience. We did a more graceful implementation of required functionality by create a new extension that extends Calendar Base (cal) &#8211; TYPO3 Extension and added new services to it. The approach makes it easier for cal extension to be upgraded to future versions as well. </p>

<p>Can a website builder that claims to create a new website in  5 or 10 or few minutes do the following: </p>



<ul><li>Study your business and create a feasible plan on short and long terms needs?</li><li>Do they know who are your target audience who could be your possible clients?</li><li>Can they find out your website visitor behavior and adapt your content, pages and website structure?</li><li>How good are they in understanding what people are looking for in search engines like Google, Bing, Yahoo and many other search engines</li><li>Can they take into account social media influence? </li><li>And do you really own the website? Can you move it to some better server? Are you stuck with it?</li><li>Can you use the best content management system for your website? </li><li>And the ready made template you might be choosing in going to same as another few thousand website owners! </li></ul>

<p>Subscription to newsletters is an essential functionality of an website. The functionality of newsletter greatly helps to stay in touch with interested visitors to the website over time. </p>



<p>When subscribing to a website we as visitors would expect things to be quick and simple. Ajax greatly helps keeping things simple by completing the functionality quickly without page re-load.</p>



<p>One of the popular Ajax Mail Subscription TYPO3 Extension was ods_ajaxmailsubscription. But unfortunately it is not maintained any longer. This brought up the opportunity to to give back some thing to the community.</p>



<p>A new Ajax based Mail Subscription TYPO3 Extension was developed and released to the TER. I am thankful to the sponsor of the extension for selecting us as the developer of this extension.</p>



<p>The extension re-used many part and functionality of the ods_ajaxmailsubscription extension and added improvements to it.</p>



<p>Some improvements were feature like use of proven cryptographically secure pseudo random number generator:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">
    /**
     * Generate a random string, using a cryptographically secure 
     * pseudorandom number generator
     * 
     * @param int $length      How many characters do we want?
     * @param string $keyspace A string of all possible characters
     *                         to select from
     * @return string
     */
    function random_str($length, $keyspace = '0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ') {
        $pieces = [];
        $max = mb_strlen($keyspace, '8bit') - 1;
        for ($i = 0; $i < $length; ++$i) {
            $pieces []= $keyspace[random_int(0, $max)];
        }
        return implode('', $pieces);
    }
</pre>



<p>Other features were:</p>



<ul><li>Auto show of popup based on Bootstrap </li><li>Disable popup based on user interest</li><li>configurable popup disable time </li><li>Email validations</li><li>Action Url expiry time settings</li><li>Multi lingual </li></ul>



<p></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.t3in.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Gridelements-BE.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-279 size-medium" src="https://blog.t3in.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Gridelements-BE-300x222.png" alt="" width="300" height="222" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Gridelements-BE-300x222.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Gridelements-BE-768x570.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Gridelements-BE-1024x759.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Gridelements-BE.png 1076w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>with Gridelements TYPO3 extension one can create multiple layouts for your website. Each grid layout form  the TYPO3 backend layout. Gridelements is very flexible and agile to use.</p>
<p>This image show use of Gridelements inside the TYPO3 CMS in backend layout.</p>
<p>T3sbootstrap uses Gridelements as dependence which means it uses the features of the extension i.e depends on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.t3in.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gridelements-fe-debug-output.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-1" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-286 alignright" src="https://blog.t3in.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gridelements-fe-debug-output-300x152.png" alt="" width="300" height="152" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gridelements-fe-debug-output-300x152.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gridelements-fe-debug-output-768x389.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gridelements-fe-debug-output-1024x519.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gridelements-fe-debug-output.png 1599w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>New layouts created using Gridelements can be used in existing/predefined T3sbootstrap layout templates. Please see  above image. After adding contents elements to the newly added columns of  Gridelements the content would show up in  the frontend view of the page of website. But things are not always smooth at times.  At times you may see only debug outputs or no output at all or error messages instead of the contents as shown in this image</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is because of a quite and rare situation in TYPO3 CMS. This is rather very small thing to miss but can be hard to figure out. The situation gets more bad because of absence of  T3sbootstrap extension documentation in English there is not wide support from non-Germans. It is only avaibale in German (at the time of writing). This causes lot of difficultly in getting started with T3sbootstrap extension and effects its popularity world wide.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>All you need to do it make sure that in the main template&#8217;s include static section  Gridelements record is above T3sbootstrap&#8217;s record. See the below image for proper understanding.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have successfully implemented our Google AMP version of T3IN.com few weeks back. All Google AMP validation passed with zero errors or warnings. The AMP site can be viewed directly from the AMP Url shared below.</p>
<p>The look and layout is mostly same. We had to make adjustments in few content element types. Although it is a work-in-progress yet it is fair to say it is presentable to the world. The AMP version of T3IN.com has been submitted to Google for indexing.</p>
<p>There were few extensions and content elements that we could not use, about which we talk in another post and if there is any probable alternate solution we could find.</p>
<p>From our huge experience of website building TYPO3 still is our most preferred Open Source CMS and seems like it would stay so for a long time.</p>
<p>AMP is very much implementable in TYPO3 CMS ! see <a href="https://amp.t3in.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google AMP implementation in TYPO3 for T3IN.COM</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) is a technology to have pages load quickly on mobile devices. AMP is backed by industry heavy weights like Google, Twitter, WordPress, several publishers and other companies. The challenge in short is that it has own HTML and JavaScript library.</p>
<p><strong>So can we use TYPO3 extension while building an website in AMP?</strong></p>
<p>The answer is : Yes we can use most of the TYPO3 extensions but we not all extension. There are exceptions. Some TYPO3 extensions are are completely non-usable and some can be used after some alter in just templates and others might need extensive change in code level.</p>
<p><strong>Why we can not use some TYPO3 extensions in websites built on AMP technology?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Google AMP has own HTML</li>
<li>You can not use your JS Libraries</li>
<li>Many tags like &lt;img src &gt; will not work</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TYPO3 has many readily available templates/themes. One of the most popular is the  bootstrap package. It is an installable extension module. Download free TYPO3 templates and themes from <a href="https://typo3.org/extensions/repository/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TYPO3 bootstrap package</a>.</p>
<p>One of the thing which I need to do was to make the slider pause on mouseover. By default it keeps sliding and mouseover had to effect on it. The solution to fix this is:</p>
<p>Add the following JavaScript to the bottom:</p>
<pre>$('.carousel-3').carousel({
    "pause":"false"
});</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here &#8220;carousel-3&#8221; is the content id of the carousel.</p>
<p>To include your JavaScript in the end of TYPO3 page at the following Typoscript code:</p>
<pre><span class="keyword2">page</span><span class="ts-operator">.</span><span class="other ts-value">includeJSFooter</span> <span class="other ts-value">{</span>
<span class="whitespace">  </span><span class="other">common</span><span class="ts-operator">-</span><span class="other">js</span> <span class="ts-operator">=</span> <span class="other ts-value">fileadmin</span><span class="other ts-value">/templates</span><span class="other ts-value">/js</span><span class="other ts-value">/common</span><span class="ts-operator">.</span><span class="other ts-value">js</span>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The newest news extension on Typo3 is the &#8220;News&#8221; extension. This extension also referred as tx_news some times is build in the latest Typo3 Extbase and fluid development platform. The older news extension was &#8220;tt_news&#8221;.</p>
<p>The latest news extension did not ad the functionality to post news items on social media. So we have developed a Typo3 module to post post news items to social media and email them as well to subscribers. News items can be posted to Facebook pages directly from Typo3 backend administration section. The module also allows to post direct content with url to social media.</p>
<p>The new extension is fully compatible with search engine optioned Urls of news any other Typo3 Seo features or extensions like realurl.<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/socialPost-1.png" rel="attachment wp-att-210" data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-210" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/socialPost-1-150x150.png" alt="socialPost-1" width="150" height="150" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/socialPost-1-150x150.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/03/socialPost-1-60x60.png 60w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/socialPost-2.png" rel="attachment wp-att-209" data-rel="lightbox-image-1" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-209" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/socialPost-2-150x150.png" alt="socialPost-2" width="150" height="150" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/socialPost-2-150x150.png 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/03/socialPost-2-60x60.png 60w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many time during coding we need to same a copy of the code file. A quick backup of the work before a some may-go-wrong kind of situations. Do not just do a copy-paste of the file. In many systems like under CentOS the file gets saved as &#8220;MyController (copy).php&#8221;.</p>
<p>This can lead to nasty situation. While you might be thinking it that the actual file &#8220;MyController.php&#8221; was being used by Typo3 it could very well be otherwise .i.e. Typo3 might just be using the copy &#8220;MyController (copy).php&#8221;!</p>
<p>So be safe and always add a prefix to the backup file name.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
