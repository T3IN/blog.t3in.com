<p>The TYPO3 extension Calendar Base (extension key: cal)  is one of the best coded extension I have come across in a long time. It was a great learning experience and the challenge was stimulating!</p>



<h4>About the extension</h4>



<p>Calendar Base extension is a full-featured online calendar system. And works with popular calendar systems such as Yahoo! Calendar, Google Calendar, and Microsoft Outlook. In addition to these common calendar systems, Calendar Base is compatible with any other applications support the iCal standard data format.</p>



<p>It shows calendar and events in various formats like days, weeks, months etc. Searches, personal calendar, RSS, exports and many more. Please see the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="cal extension documentation (opens in a new tab)" href="https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/cal/stable/" target="_blank">cal extension documentation</a> for more details.</p>



<h4>The magic inside</h4>



<p>Unlike many TYPO3 extension cal is highly flexible in configuration and hence can be a bit of complicated job to configure it at times. Mostly of the things are implemented as service. And it has multiple controllers like the main controller, the frontend controller and the backend controller.</p>



<h4>Extending Calendar Base (cal)</h4>



<p>While working on extending Calendar Base (cal) we came across few approaches by other but most seemed novice or &#8220;dirty&#8221; implementations. Few used JavaScript to alter the frontend view and some used TypoScript as a work around. None seem to understand the beauty of code of this extension. Given the scarce information is certainly was a task that would take lot more effort.</p>



<h4>Event search with multiple category selection with category stats</h4>



<p>Getting inside the code of the extension and understanding it implementation was a great experience. We did a more graceful implementation of required functionality by create a new extension that extends Calendar Base (cal) &#8211; TYPO3 Extension and added new services to it. The approach makes it easier for cal extension to be upgraded to future versions as well. </p>

<p>Subscription to newsletters is an essential functionality of an website. The functionality of newsletter greatly helps to stay in touch with interested visitors to the website over time. </p>



<p>When subscribing to a website we as visitors would expect things to be quick and simple. Ajax greatly helps keeping things simple by completing the functionality quickly without page re-load.</p>



<p>One of the popular Ajax Mail Subscription TYPO3 Extension was ods_ajaxmailsubscription. But unfortunately it is not maintained any longer. This brought up the opportunity to to give back some thing to the community.</p>



<p>A new Ajax based Mail Subscription TYPO3 Extension was developed and released to the TER. I am thankful to the sponsor of the extension for selecting us as the developer of this extension.</p>



<p>The extension re-used many part and functionality of the ods_ajaxmailsubscription extension and added improvements to it.</p>



<p>Some improvements were feature like use of proven cryptographically secure pseudo random number generator:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">
    /**
     * Generate a random string, using a cryptographically secure 
     * pseudorandom number generator
     * 
     * @param int $length      How many characters do we want?
     * @param string $keyspace A string of all possible characters
     *                         to select from
     * @return string
     */
    function random_str($length, $keyspace = '0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ') {
        $pieces = [];
        $max = mb_strlen($keyspace, '8bit') - 1;
        for ($i = 0; $i < $length; ++$i) {
            $pieces []= $keyspace[random_int(0, $max)];
        }
        return implode('', $pieces);
    }
</pre>



<p>Other features were:</p>



<ul><li>Auto show of popup based on Bootstrap </li><li>Disable popup based on user interest</li><li>configurable popup disable time </li><li>Email validations</li><li>Action Url expiry time settings</li><li>Multi lingual </li></ul>



<p></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>T3sbootstrap is a very popular TYPO3 extension. It can build bootstrap based websites in TYPO3 CMS. Gridelements is another very useful and popular extension. BothT3sbootstrap and Gridelements TYPO3 extensions are available for free in TYPO3 Extension Repository (TER).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.t3in.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Gridelements-BE.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-0" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-279 size-medium" src="https://blog.t3in.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Gridelements-BE-300x222.png" alt="" width="300" height="222" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Gridelements-BE-300x222.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Gridelements-BE-768x570.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Gridelements-BE-1024x759.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Gridelements-BE.png 1076w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>with Gridelements TYPO3 extension one can create multiple layouts for your website. Each grid layout form  the TYPO3 backend layout. Gridelements is very flexible and agile to use.</p>
<p>This image show use of Gridelements inside the TYPO3 CMS in backend layout.</p>
<p>T3sbootstrap uses Gridelements as dependence which means it uses the features of the extension i.e depends on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.t3in.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gridelements-fe-debug-output.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-1" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-286 alignright" src="https://blog.t3in.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gridelements-fe-debug-output-300x152.png" alt="" width="300" height="152" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gridelements-fe-debug-output-300x152.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gridelements-fe-debug-output-768x389.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gridelements-fe-debug-output-1024x519.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gridelements-fe-debug-output.png 1599w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>New layouts created using Gridelements can be used in existing/predefined T3sbootstrap layout templates. Please see  above image. After adding contents elements to the newly added columns of  Gridelements the content would show up in  the frontend view of the page of website. But things are not always smooth at times.  At times you may see only debug outputs or no output at all or error messages instead of the contents as shown in this image</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is because of a quite and rare situation in TYPO3 CMS. This is rather very small thing to miss but can be hard to figure out. The situation gets more bad because of absence of  T3sbootstrap extension documentation in English there is not wide support from non-Germans. It is only avaibale in German (at the time of writing). This causes lot of difficultly in getting started with T3sbootstrap extension and effects its popularity world wide.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
<p>All you need to do it make sure that in the main template&#8217;s include static section  Gridelements record is above T3sbootstrap&#8217;s record. See the below image for proper understanding.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.t3in.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/include-static-main.png" data-rel="lightbox-image-2" data-rl_title="" data-rl_caption="" title=""><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-303 aligncenter" src="https://blog.t3in.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/include-static-main-300x210.png" alt="" width="300" height="210" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/include-static-main-300x210.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/11/include-static-main-768x537.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/11/include-static-main-1024x716.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/11/include-static-main.png 1081w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have successfully implemented our Google AMP version of T3IN.com few weeks back. All Google AMP validation passed with zero errors or warnings. The AMP site can be viewed directly from the AMP Url shared below.</p>
<p>The look and layout is mostly same. We had to make adjustments in few content element types. Although it is a work-in-progress yet it is fair to say it is presentable to the world. The AMP version of T3IN.com has been submitted to Google for indexing.</p>
<p>There were few extensions and content elements that we could not use, about which we talk in another post and if there is any probable alternate solution we could find.</p>
<p>From our huge experience of website building TYPO3 still is our most preferred Open Source CMS and seems like it would stay so for a long time.</p>
<p>AMP is very much implementable in TYPO3 CMS ! see <a href="https://amp.t3in.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google AMP implementation in TYPO3 for T3IN.COM</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Problem: Flexform does not respect language settings.</p>
<p>Detail: The website in built in TemplaVoila template engine on Typo3 4.x version. But the flexform  was not behaving as expected. Some issues were:</p>
<ol>
<li>What ever we put as value in default language field it would put the same value in the respective language field.</li>
<li>In the frontend the Extbase based extension plugin would show only the value of the default language irrespective of the language selected.</li>
</ol>
<p>Search results related to the problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>A very same bug was posted in Typo3 bug reporter in 2013 but nothing was done about it &lt; link to Typo3 bug report &gt;</li>
</ul>
<p>Solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disabled multiple language in Flexform</li>
<li>Placed the FE plugin in all the alternative language pages</li>
<li>Added new Extbase code in the repository file of the Typo3 extension to raw access the database and get the translated record and show it in the frontend</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We recently upgraded one Typo3 implemented website to Typo3 6.2 Long Term Support (LTS) version. Typo3 6.2 LTS has a all new Typo3 Install Tool which by the way also includes &#8220;Core Updater&#8221; much like in WordPress CMS but we talk about it in another blog. So lets go to the point.</p>
<p>To uninstall the broken or non-compatible extension in Typo3 admin follow these simple steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>In file /typo3conf/PackageStates.php make the &#8216;state&#8217; =&gt; &#8216;inactive&#8217; against the extension you want to uninstall</li>
<li>then Delete all cache files under /typo3temp/Cache/</li>
</ul>
<p>And you are done! Reload your Typo3 admin now.</p>
